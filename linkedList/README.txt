This project is a practice in creating classes, templating, implementing a linked list and solving problems using the linked list.

The methods in the interface that have the comment "\\dailyByte" next to them are solutions to given problems that I felt had a place staying in my implemented linked list.

The rest of the solutions to the problems are given in the main.cpp file as functions.

This project was created in visual studio and therefore it has no make file, which would be needed for compilation outside of visual studio.
